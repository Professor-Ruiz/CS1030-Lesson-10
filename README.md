# Lesson 10 Programming Assignment

> Every week, Crumbl rotates at least three specialty cookies on their menu. They'd like to display these cookies alphabetically on their menu. Write a program to help them out with this.

## Objectives
- Practice using conditionals to solve problems.
- Learn how to create flowcharts, and include them in your assignment submissions.

## Directions
- Before writing any code, develop your algorithm. Create a flowchart to represent your program logic.
    - [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a free tool you can use to create flowcharts. It is linked to your google account.
    - From the file menu, select ***Export As***, then choose ***JPG***.
    - Save your flowchart as ***lesson10flowchart.jpg***.
- Your program should accept three strings in any order, and print them in ascending alphabetical order to the console. 
- The only data types allowed are strings (no lists). You cannot use looping or any predefined function or method.
- The user prompt and output should be formatted exactly as the example below, down to the spaces.
  ```
  Enter flavor one: Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  Enter flavor two: Biscoff Lava
  Enter flavor three: Pumpkin Chocolate Chip

  Biscoff Lava
  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip
  Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  ```
- Test your program by running it several times with different inputs. Verify your algorithm is correct by checking the program output.
- Add the required docstring to the top of your program:
  ```

## Submission
[Link to video directions](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/28c07f3f-c012-48c1-bcc3-c807c98728cc)
1. From the ***Add file*** pull-down menu above, select ***Upload files***.
2. Upload your ***lesson10.py*** and ***lesson10flowchart.jpg*** files.
3. Click the green "***Commit changes***" button.
4. If you see both ***lesson10.py*** and ***lesson10flowchart.jpg*** files in the repository, your submission was successful.
## Check Test Cases (Optional)
1. Select the ***Actions*** menu item near the top center of the screen.
2. If ***Add files via upload***'s icon is a yellow-orange icon, it is still processing. Give it time.
3. If a green check mark icon appears to the left of ***Add files via upload***, congratulations! Your code passed all test cases.
4. If a red x icon appears to the left of ***Add files via upload***, your code failed the tests. 
    - Click ***Add files via upload***, then the ***autograding*** button, to find clues as to why your code failed. 
    - Open your IDE and debug your program, then resubmit on GitHub.
