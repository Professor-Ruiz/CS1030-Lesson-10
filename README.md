## Objectives
- Formulate a working solution to a business problem that incorporates the use of conditionals.
- Construct a flowchart that demonstrates the logic of an algorithm.

## Directions
- Design a program that accepts three strings in any order, and prints them in ascending alphabetical order to the console. The only data types allowed are strings (no lists). You cannot use looping or any predefined function or method.

- Develop your algorithm before writing any code. Create a flowchart to illustrate your logic.
    - [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a free and easy tool you can use to create flowcharts. 
    - I created an [instructional video](https://youtu.be/oy5nhA7QpNI) for creating and submitting flowcharts.
    
- Format the user prompt and output exactly as shown in the example below:

  ```
  Enter flavor one: Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  Enter flavor two: Biscoff Lava
  Enter flavor three: Pumpkin Chocolate Chip

  Biscoff Lava
  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip
  Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  ```
  
- Test your program by running it several times with different inputs. Verify your algorithm is correct by checking the program output.

- Add the required docstring to the top of your program:
  ```
