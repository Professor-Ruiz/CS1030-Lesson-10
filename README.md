# Lesson 10 Programming Assignment

>
> Every week, Crumbl rotates at least three specialty cookies on their menu. They'd like to display these cookies alphabetically on their menu. Write a program to help them out with this.

## Objectives
- Practice using conditionals to solve problems.
- Learn how to create flowcharts, and include them in your assignment submissions.

## Directions
- Your program should accept three strings in any order, and print them in ascending alphabetical order to the console. The only data types allowed are strings (no lists). You cannot use looping or any predefined function or method.

- Before writing any code, develop your algorithm. Create a flowchart to represent your program logic.
    - [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) is a free and easy tool you can use to create flowcharts. 
    - I created an [instructional video](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/3284175f-4442-46d1-bc69-7d6af21d8fa6) for creating flowcharts.
    
- The user prompt and output should be formatted exactly as the example below:
  ```
  Enter flavor one: Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  Enter flavor two: Biscoff Lava
  Enter flavor three: Pumpkin Chocolate Chip

  Biscoff Lava
  Pumpkin Chocolate Chip
  Snickerdoodle Cupcake
  ```
  
- Test your program by running it several times with different inputs. Verify your algorithm is correct by checking the program output.

- Add the required docstring to the top of your program:
  ```
